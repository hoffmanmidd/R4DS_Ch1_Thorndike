Mimic R4DS chapter 1 using data from Thorndike textbook example

This data and analysis corresponds to R for Data Science (2e) Chapter 1: Data Visualization https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize where the R4DS authors ask "Do penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers?" 

Simlarly, using data from Thorndike & Thorndike-Christ (2011), chapter 2, page 23, we might ask: "To what extent do those who excel in reading also
excel in mathematics?"

The data is from the Thorndike textbook example:

“Catherine Johnson and Peter Cordero wanted to gather information about acheivement levels in their two sixth-grade classes. They gave their students a 45-item reading comprehension test provided in their current reading series, a 65-item review test from the mathematics book, and a dictation spelling test of 80 items based on the words their classes had been studying during the past 6 weeks.”
